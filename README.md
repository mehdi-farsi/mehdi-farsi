## Hi there, fellow Rubyists! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

#### Who am I?

I'm Mehdi, the creator and solo maintainer of [RubyCademy](https://rubycademy.com), a platform to help you learn and improve your Ruby and Rails skills.

I believe that learning should be for everyone, which is why I share free content on social media, even though RubyCademy itself is a paid platform.

#### My mission

- 💪 I am working on making learning Ruby fun and effective for developers at all levels.
- ⭐ I have been coding in Ruby since 2012 and sharing knowledge since 2016. Still learning new things every day.
- ✌️ Join us, and let’s keep improving our skills together!

#### Where can you find me?

If you enjoy fun Ruby code, follow me on [X.com/RubyCademy](https://x.com/RubyCademy), where I share Ruby Cards, interesting challenges, and code examples every day. 🎉

I am always happy to connect with other developers, so feel free to reach out! Let’s make learning awesome.

Thanks for taking the time to read my presentation!

PS: Enjoy our special Black Friday offer 👉 [RubyCademy](https://www.rubycademy.com)
