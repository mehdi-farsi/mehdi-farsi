Hey, I’m Mehdi 👋

Just like you, I have a deep passion for Ruby and Rails. Over the years, I’ve explored the language inside and out, and it would be my honor to share everything I’ve learned with you.

If you enjoy discovering interesting Ruby quirks, best practices, and deep insights, you might like [RubyCademy](https://www.rubycademy.com)—a place where I share knowledge to help fellow developers grow.

I also post daily Ruby insights on [x.com/RubyCademy](https://x.com/RubyCademy). Would love to have you there!

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! 🙏
