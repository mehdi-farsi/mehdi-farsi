### Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Mehdi, the creator and sole maintainer of [RubyCademy](https://www.rubycademy.com), a platform for learning and improving your Ruby and Rails skills.

I believe that learning should be accessible to everyone, which is why I share free content on social media, even though RubyCademy is a paid platform.

If you enjoy fun Ruby code, follow me on [X.com/RubyCademy](https://x.com/RubyCademy), where I share Ruby Cards, interesting challenges, and code examples daily!

I am always happy to connect with other developers, so feel free to reach out!
