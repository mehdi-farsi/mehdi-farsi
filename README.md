👋

I have a deep passion for Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Over the years, I’ve explored the language inside and out, and it would be my honor to share everything I’ve learned with you.

If you enjoy discovering interesting tips, best practices, and deep insights, you might like [RubyCademy](https://www.rubycademy.com), a place where I share everything I learn.

I also post daily Ruby insights on [x.com/RubyCademy](https://x.com/intent/user?screen_name=RubyCademy). Would love to have you there!

Thank you for taking the time to read this message! 🙏
